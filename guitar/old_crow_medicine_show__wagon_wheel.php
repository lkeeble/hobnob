Capo 2nd fret

[Intro]

G D Em C G D C
G D Em C G D C

[Verse 1]

G                         D                       Em                   C
Headed down south to the land of the pines, I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
G                        D                    C
Starin’ up the road and pray to God I see headlights
G                               D             Em                
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours,  Pickin’ me a bouquet of 
C
dogwood flowers
G                              D                   C
And I'm a hopin’ for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]

    G                   D            Em              C 
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel, Rock me mama anyway you feel
G    D      C
Hey… mama rock me
G                       D                 Em                   C
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain, Rock me mama like a south-bound train
G    D      C
Hey… mama rock me

[Break]

G D Em C G D C

[Verse 2]

G                           D                  Em                          
Runnin' from the cold up in New England, I was born to be a fiddler in an 
C
old-time string band
G                         D               C
My baby plays the guitar, I pick a banjo now 
G                                      D                      Em   
Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin’ me now, Lost my money playin’
            C 
poker so I had to up and leave
G                               D                    C
But I ain’t a turnin’ back to livin’ that old life no more

[Chorus]

    G                    D           Em              C 
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel, Rock me mama anyway you feel
G    D      C
Hey… mama rock me
G                       D                 Em                   C
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain, Rock me mama like a south-bound train
G    D      C
Hey… mama rock me

[Break]

G D Em C G D C

Strum each note once:

[Verse 3]

G                             D                   Em                    
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke, I caught a trucker out of Philly, had
   C
a nice long toke
     G                               D               C
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap to Johnson City, Tennessee

Back to normal strumming pattern:
G                          D                          Em           
And I gotta get a move on fit for the sun, I hear my baby callin’ my name,
       C
and I know that she's the only one
G                             D               C
And if I die in Raleigh, at least I will die free

[Chorus]

    G                    D           Em              C 
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel, Rock me mama anyway you feel
G    D      C
Hey… mama rock me
G                       D                 Em                   C
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain, Rock me mama like a south-bound train
G    D      C       C… D… G…
Hey… mama rock me…
