Capo 2nd fret

[Verse 1]
Em                             Am   
She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Em                 Am
Zero hour    nine a.m.
C                G  Am              D
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then

Em                         Am 
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife
Em                 Am
It's lonely out in space
C         G              Am        D
On such a timeless flight 

[Chorus]
G                                     C
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                          G
Till touch down brings me round again to find
                                      C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
         G                A7
Oh no no no  ....  I'm a rocket man
C                                  G
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
C

[Verse 2]
Em                              Am
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
Em                   Am
In fact it's cold as hell
C                  G        C                 D
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
Em                           Am
And all this science I don't understand
Em                           Am
It's just my job five days a week
         C    G    Am             D
A rocket man,              rocket man

[Chorus]
G                                     C
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                         G  
Till touch down brings me round again to find
                                    C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
         G        A7
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man
C                                  G
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
C

C                               G
    And I think it's gonna be a long long time
C                               G
    And I think it's gonna be a long long time
C                               G
    And I think it's gonna be a long long time
