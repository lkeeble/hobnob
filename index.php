<a href="chat/chat.php" target="_new">Chat Room</a> <br>
Pick a chat board name, give the URL for your chat board to other users that you want to invite (you could sent it to them by email). 
<br>
Code for the chatroom application can be freely downloaded, copied and used from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lkeeble/chat">https://bitbucket.org/lkeeble/chat</a>
<br>
You can easily include it in your own website if your web hosting service supports PHP 5.2 or higher. I suggest you make a /chat folder beneath the root folder of your web site and copy all of the files there. 
This new /chat folder should be made writeable on the web host's file system, otherwise you won't be able to see messages from other users. There is no complicated database install or setup because it uses <a href="www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>.

Code for the scribble application can be freely downloaded, copied and used from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lkeeble/jsscribble">https://bitbucket.org/lkeeble/jsscribble</a>
<br>
This can be included in your own website if you want, see above instructions for chat, and install in a similar way. Note the need to make the installation folder writable.
