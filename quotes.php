<p>Danny Boyle (UK director):</p>

<p>“I was meant to be a priest until I was 14, I was going to transfer to a seminary near Wigan. But this priest, Father Conway, took me aside and said, ‘I don’t think you should go’. Whether he was saving me from the priesthood or the priesthood from me, I don’t know. But quite soon after, I started doing drama. And there’s a real connection, I think. All these directors —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" > Martin Scorsese</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Woo" > John Woo</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan" > M.

<p>Jeff Bridges on relationships and love:</p>

<p>Well, that's certainly true. This industry is tough on relationships. I've always thought that my wife should have a credit up alongside mine, because I couldn't do what I do without her support. And like the questioner asked, or said, we've been married since 1977, we knew each other for 2 years before that, so she's been able to do all these films with me and we've managed to get through them all together. The toughest thing about making movies is being apart from your family. One of the things I try my best to do is call my wife every day, to keep up to speed with what's going on in her life. And tell her what's going on with mine. Often when you're apart from your loved one like that for so long, your connection kind of atrophies unless you keep engaged, even if it's small everyday kind of stuff. But another aspect of keeping a marriage together, I think it's important to - you'll think I'm silly - but to love each other, which begs the question: "what is love?" Words that come to mind are openness, understanding, gentleness, kindness, and kind of working on those things, because everyone has a light and a dark side, I think, selfish aspects, and to kind of recognize those in each other and realize that we are going to have our own particular story at any given time, and those stories, they might not be the ultimate truth but they are certainly true for each of us, so to understand that we are each going through our particular version of reality, to respect that, and to nurture being in love, you know? To nurture that. </p>

<br />
<p>From an article on marrying the wrong person: </p>

<p>http://www.philosophersmail.com/relationships/how-we-end-up-marrying-the-wrong-people/</p>

<p>Part of the reason we feel like getting married is to interrupt the all-consuming grip that love has over our psyches. We are exhausted by the melodramas and thrills that go nowhere. We are restless for other challenges. We hope that marriage can conclusively end love’s painful rule over our lives. It can’t and won’t: there is as much doubt, hope, fear, rejection and betrayal in a marriage as there is in single life. It’s only from the outside that a marriage looks peaceful, uneventful and nicely boring.</p>

<p>I hate to say "never" but I think it's impossible really. Because we were inventing it as we went along. And it was a blank canvas, and we could paint in very broad brushstrokes. And the media outlets were very limited, so you only had to make some kind of impact and meet people and make connections and the whole thing became self-perpetuatin'. I know there's this whole thing with social media that i don't really understand, it's beyond me, but it seems to me like a lot of good music gets lost in it. Whereas in our time, you had to buy an album, you had to buy 10-12 tracks, and you might have only liked 4 of them, and I always found that some of the songs I didn't like initially ended up after a few plays being my favourite songs. And the ones I bought the album for int eh first place became my least favourite! I think there's something about the internet now, that because you can download just a few tracks, that something gets lost. And that's why I'm still a great proponent of vinyl, because not only does it sound better, but as an artistic format, the album cover, the scale of it, the shape of it, it's the perfect artistic statement. And they sound so much better, there's no doubt about it. And it becomes more personal because if you scratch it, there's a scratch there from you. SO there are these things on vinyl that will never live on in digital. The coffee stains on the cover.</p>

<p>“the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work”</p>

<p>-Bertrand Russell</p>

<br />
<p>“If you want to really hurt you parents, and you don't have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possible can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.”</p>

<p>Will Rogers Quotes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One of Will Rogers' most famous lines, "I have never yet met a man that I didnt like," was part of a longer quotation and in its original form was in reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky" >Leon Trotsky</a>:</p>

</li>
<li><p>"I bet you if I had met him and had a chat with him, I would have found him a very interesting and human fellow, for I never yet met a man that I dident like. When you meet people, no matter what opinion you might have formed about them beforehand, why, after you meet them and see their angle and their personality, why, you can see a lot of good in all of them.<href="#cite_note-28" >[29]</a> Note that "dident" was a spelling choice that Rogers used repeatedly.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>"The average citizen knows only too well that it makes no difference to him which side wins. He realizes that the Republican elephant and the Democratic donkey have come to resemble each other so closely that it is practically impossible to tell them apart; both of them make the same braying noise, and neither of them ever says anything. The only perceptible difference is that the elephant is somewhat the larger of the two.<href="#cite_note-29" >[30]</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>"Every guy just looks in his own pocket and then votes. And the funny part of it is that it's the last year of an administration that counts. [A president] can have three bad ones and then wind up with everybody having money in the fourth, and the incumbent will win so far he needn't even stay up to hear the returns.

It was someone who had neglected their mother for years, and then they figured out: I got to do something about Momma. And knowing Momma was that easy, they figured, “we'll give her a day, and it will be all right with Momma.” Give her a day, and then in return Momma gives you the other 364.

But they both feel the same, the hero and the coward. People who watch you judge you on what you do, not how you feel.</p>

<p>Whenever women have insisted on absolute equality with men, they have invariably wound up with the dirty end of the stick.

<p>I favor heavily what I did. Friday afternoons for years - great thoughts only - means that I committed 10% of my time</p>

<p>trying to understand the bigger problems in the field, i.e. what was and what was not important.</p>

<p>I found in the early days I had believed `this' and yet had spent all week marching in `that' direction.</p>

<p>It was kind of foolish. If I really believe the action is over there, why do I march in this direction?</p>

<p>I either had to change my goal or change what I did. So I changed something I did and I marched</p>

<br />
<p>Rob Pike on Complexity</p>

<p>------------------------</p>

<p>Rule 1. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. </p>

<p>Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack</p>

<p>until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.</p>

<p>Rule 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part of the code</p>

<p>overwhelms the rest.</p>

<p>Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants.</p>

<p>Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.) For example, binary trees are always faster than splay trees for workaday problems.</p>

<p>Rule 4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. </p>

<p>Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.</p>

<br />
<p>The following data structures are a complete list for almost all practical programs:</p>

<p>array</p>

<p>linked list</p>

<p>hash table</p>

<p>binary tree</p>

<br />
<p>Of course, you must also be prepared to collect these into compound data structures. </p>

<p>For instance, a symbol table might be implemented as a hash table containing linked lists of</p>

<p>arrays of characters.</p>

<br />
<p>Rule 5. Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well,</p>

<p>the algorithms will almost always be self­evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming. </p>

<p>(See Brooks p. 102.)</p>

<br />
<p>Rule 6. There is no Rule 6.</p>

<p>How do we convince people that in programming simplicity</p>

<p>and clarity in short: what mathematicians call "elegance" are not a dispensable luxury,</p>

<p>but a crucial matter that decides between success and failure?</p>

<p> Edsger W. Dijkstra</p>

<br />
<p>Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren't doing anything.</p>

<p>One of the attractive things about programmers is that</p>

<p>you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them.</p>

<p>Very often they're sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping,</p>

<p>or just staring into space. What the programmer is trying to do</p>

<p>is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.</p>

<p>-Charles M. Strauss</p>

<br />
<p>Q: What is the most often-overlooked risk in software engineering?</p>

<p>A: Incompetent programmers. There are estimates that the number of programmers needed in the U.S.</p>

<p>exceeds 200,000. This is entirely misleading. It is not a quantity problem; we have a quality problem.</p>

<p>One bad programmer can easily create two new jobs a year. Hiring more bad programmers will just increase our</p>

<p>perceived need for them. If we had more good programmers, and could easily identify them,</p>

<p>we would need fewer, not more.</p>

<p>Functional, whether lazy or non-lazy, means no side effect.</p>

<p>It doesnt mess about behind the scenes  it doesnt launch the missiles, it doesnt write to the disk.</p>

<p>So the message of the presentation I mentioned before is that purely functional programming is by default, safe for parallel programming, and mainstream programming is by default dangerous.</p>

<p>-Simon Peyton-Jones</p>

<br />
<p>In a lazy language, you dont evaluate the 3+4 because f might ignore it,</p>

<p>in which case all that work computing 3+4 was wasted.</p>

<p>In a lazy language, you evaluate expressions only when their value is actually required,</p>

<p>not when you call a function - its call by need.</p>

<p>A lazy person waits until their manager says I really need that report now,</p>

<p>whereas an eager will have it in their draw all done, but maybe their manager will never ask for it.</p>

<p>Currently the mind think in software engineering is that it takes a big team to</p>

<p>do anything worthwhile. This also happened in the mid 80s on the mainframe.</p>

<p>What is required is good tools to enable good developers to write large systems. It also requires experienced managers who understand</p>

<p>how large systems evolve.</p>

<p>Brooks was right and the industry still doesn't do what he said to do 30 years ago.</p>

<p>I've worked in small teams that have many orders of magnitude more productivity than other larger teams.</p>

<p>The software produced was cheap, robust and extension-able. Bug counts were zero when we shipped.</p>

<p>There was no secret as to how we did this.</p>

<p>We fired bad developers. Winners will not tolerate losers on the team.</p>

<p>Everybody had a clearly defined responsibility. If something did not work there was no hand waving.</p>

<p>We designed software as simulations not abstract models.</p>

<p>We automated everything. No manual time sheets. Project tracking we could identify how much time a bug cost the project and who was</p>

<p>responsible for the bug.</p>

<p>We used tools/frameworks that enabled us to work on single level abstractions.</p>

<p>We worked six hours a day split into three two hour periods with no interruptions. No phone calls, no visitors no distractions.</p>

<p>We took six+ weeks a year vacation plus used our sick days.</p>

<p>What made this possible was a culture that rewarded success and reported failure.</p>

<br />
<p>Its also important to try out the program on users to make sure it solves real users needs.</p>

<p>And thats where this company is going astray; its ignoring users.</p>

<p>Theyve gotten caught up in marketing, and what theyre really fighting are other marketers.</p>

<p>All the ads are done by marketers, theyre not done by users saying this is what we need.</p>

<p>Its one marketer, trying to pit his or her skills against another marketer,</p>

<p>so theyre fighting the battle of the specs.</p>

<p>-C. Wayne Ratliff, P125</p>

<br />
<p>While youre working hard on a complicated program, its important to exercise.</p>

<p>The lack of physical exercise does most programmers in.</p>

<p>It causes a loss of mental acuity.</p>

<p>It also leads to physical weakness that can heighten the feeling of disillusionment</p>

<p>that often comes after the second or third straight programming effort.</p>

<p>-Jon Page, P107</p>

<br />
<p>The most important goal is to define as precisely as possible the interfaces</p>

<p>between the system and the rest of the world,</p>

<p>as well as the interfaces between the major parts of the system itself.</p>

<p>The biggest change in my design style over the years has been to put more and more</p>

<p>emphasis on the problem to be solved and on finding techniques to define the interfaces precisely.</p>

<p>That pays off tremendously, both in a better understanding of what the program really does,</p>

<p>and in identification of the crucial parts.</p>

<p>It also help people understand how the system is put together.</p>

<p>Thats really the most important aspect of designing a program.</p>

<p>-Butler Lampson, P33</p>

<br />
<p>To hell with computer literacy. Its absolutely ridiculous.</p>

<p>Study mathematics. Learn to think. Read. Write.</p>

<p>These things are of more enduring value. Learn how to prove theorems.</p>

<p>this skill is transferable to many other things.</p>

<p>To study only programming is absurd.</p>

<p>-Butler Lampson, P38</p>

<br />
<p>I think a lot before I do anything, and once I do something,</p>

<p>Im not afraid to throw it away.</p>

<p>Its very important that a programmer be able to look at a piece of code</p>

<p>like a bad chapter of a book and scrap it without looking back.</p>

<p>Never get too enamored with one idea, never hang onto anything tenaciously</p>

<p>without being able to throw it away when necessary;</p>

<p>that should be the programmers attitude.</p>

<p>-John Warnock, P47</p>

<br />
<p>Dont bind early; dont ever make decisions earlier than you have to.</p>

<p>Stay an order of magnitude more general than you think you need,</p>

<p>because you will end up needing it in the long term.</p>

<p>Get something working very quickly and then be able to throw it away.</p>

<p>Learn from small experiments rather than large ones.</p>

<p>Dont go into a two-year development with nothing coming out in the middle.</p>

<p>Have something come out every two months, so you can evaluate, regroup, and restart.</p>

<p>-John Warnock, P52</p>

<br />
<p>The trick is to learn from the Hewlett-Packard approach: Keep it as twenty different, small companies.</p>

<p>Keep breaking it up and never let it become a huge organization, except at some level that nobody cares about.</p>

<p>In terms of working relationships, keep the number of people small and their focus localized, project-oriented,</p>

<p>so they can work at their best.</p>

<p>-John Warnock, P54</p>

<br />
<p>Part of our strategy is getting the programmers to think everything through before they go to the coding phase.</p>

<p>Writing the design document is crucial, because a lot of simplification comes when you see problems</p>

<p>expressed as algorithms. Theyre kind of in the smallest form then, where you can see what the overlap is.</p>

<p>-Bill Gates, P74</p>

<br />
<p>The most important part of writing a program is designing the data structures.</p>

<p>The second most important part is breaking the various code pieces down.</p>

<p>-Bill Gates, P76</p>

<br />
<p>Features are kind of crummy in a way, because the more features you have, the bigger the manual is.</p>

<p>And features are only beneficial if people take the time to use them, wheras speed</p>

<p> if you can print the pages faster, or show it on the screen faster, or recalc it faster</p>

<p> thats worth an incredible amount.</p>

<p>If you can give the users a few simple commands and make the program efficient enough</p>

<p>to do what they want with those few commands, then youre much better off.</p>

<p>One sign of very good programs is that even internally they follow that philosophy of simplicity.</p>

<p>If they want to do something complex, they call the code with simple operations internally,</p>

<p>rather than doing the complex operation from scratch.</p>

<p>-Bill Gates, P78</p>

<br />
<p>I still think that one of the finest tests of programming ability is to hand the programmer</p>

<p>about 30 pages of code and see how quickly he can read through and understand it.</p>

<p>-Bill Gates, P83</p>

<br />
<p>Complicated programs are far easier to write than straightforward programs</p>

<p> the exact opposite of what youd expect. Its easy to write complicated programs because you</p>

<p>reflect the complexity back onto the user; you force the user to make all the hard decisions.</p>

<p>-John Page, P95</p>

<br />
<p>Company employees need to feel ownership of what theyre doing and have psychological ownership</p>

<p>of the ideas theyre implementing, otherwise theyre not motivated.</p>

<p>-John Page, P97</p>

<br />

<p>while a good programmer gives the customer a flawless, boring experience on their computer.</p>

<br />
<p>Dont assume you know all that much, and try to learn and question the assumptions.</p>

<p>Have a lot of confidence, but stay modest and assume youre doing something wrong.</p>

<p>Get just enough guilt  not too much or youll be afraid to do anything </p>

<p>but enough to develop an aesthetic sense. Try to develop a deeper understanding.</p>

<p>-Bob Frankston, P159</p>

<br />
<p>Bugs are often characteristic of a bad interface between subsystems,</p>

<p>which is frequently a result of inadequate communication among people when they design the subsystems.</p>

<p>program as a whole.</p>

<p>-Ray Ozzie, P186</p>

<br />
<p>Programming is the ultimate field for someone who likes to tinker.</p>

<p>Tinkering requires tools. Electrical engineers have various components they can put together to build something.</p>

<p>But theyre constrained by the availability of physical equipment.</p>

<p>With a computer, if you can think about it, you can do it.</p>

<p>You can design your own tools or create the parts as you go along.</p>

<p>If you dont like something, you can just change it or rewrite it.</p>

<p>Its a wide-open tool box, given the resource, the computer.</p>

<p>The only limiting factors are the amount of time it takes the computer to do the task and the amount</p>

<p>of time it takes you to write the program.</p>

<p>-Ray Ozzie, P188</p>

<br />
<p>Ive seen many intelligent people who are just not practical.</p>

<p>They get lost pursuing some academic goal that is totally useless.</p>

<p>Being practical is important to good programming.</p>

<p>You must be able to guess accurately how long it will take to complete a project,</p>

<p>have the ability to calculate what can and cannot be done in that time,</p>

<p>and then do it, resisting the temptation to go off and do other things.</p>

<p>Practicality is important when youre trying to make every piece of work the best</p>

<p>because you always have a limited amount of time to work on it.</p>

<p>Its easy to triple the time to complete a project when youre consumed</p>

<p>with making it the ultimate in elegance.</p>

<p>1. The fact that a believer is happier than a sceptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality. - George Bernard Shaw</p>

<p>2. Faith means not wanting to know what is true. - Friedrich Nietzsche</p>

<p>3. I believe in God, only I spell it Nature. - Frank Lloyd Wright</p>

<p>4. We must question the story logic of having an all-knowing all-powerful God, who creates faulty Humans, and then blames them for his own mistakes. - Gene Roddenberry</p>

<p>5. To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today. - Isaac Asimov</p>

<p>6. A man is accepted into a church for what he believes and he is turned out for what he knows. - Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain)</p>

<p>7. Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful. - Seneca the Younger</p>

<p>8. Philosophy is questions that may never be answered. Religion is answers that may never be questioned. - Anonymous</p>

<p>9. Not only is there no god, but try getting a plumber on weekends. - Woody Allen</p>

<p>10. If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul. - Isaac Asimov</p>

<p>11. Belief in the supernatural reflects a failure of the imagination. - Edward Abbey</p>

<p>12. With or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion. - Steven Weinberg</p>

<p>13. I still say a church steeple with a lightning rod on top shows a lack of confidence. - Doug McLeod</p>

<p>14. The world holds two classes of men - intelligent men without religion, and religious men without intelligence. - AbulAla al Maarri</p>

<p>15. Since the Bible and the church are obviously mistaken in telling us where we came from, how can we trust them to tell us where we are going? - Anonymous</p>

<p>18. Two hands working can do more than a thousand clasped in prayer. - Anonymous</p>

<p>19. Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation; all of which may be guides to an outward moral virtue, even if religion vanished; but religious superstition dismounts all these and erects an absolute monarchy in the minds of men. - Francis Bacon</p>

<p>20. The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully. - Richard Dawkins</p>

<p>21. A God who kept tinkering with the universe was absurd; a God who interfered with human freedom and creativity was tyrant. If God is seen as a self in a world of his own, an ego that relates to a thought, a cause separate from its effect. he becomes a being, not Being itself. An omnipotent, all knowing tyrant is not so different from earthly dictators who make everything and everybody mere cogs in the machine which they controlled. An atheism that rejects such a God is amply justified. - Karen Armstrong</p>

<p>22. It is not as in the Bible, that God created man in his own image. But, on the contrary, man created God in his own image. - Ludwig Feuerbach</p>

<p>32. You do not need the Bible to justify love, but no better tool has been invented to justify hate. - Richard A. Weatherwax</p>

<p>33. What's "God"? Well, you know, when you want something really bad and you close your eyes and you wish for it? God's the guy that ignores you. - Steve Buscemi</p>

<p>34. As far as I can tell from studying the scriptures, all you do in heaven is pretty much just sit around all day and praise the Lord. I don't know about you, but I think that after the first, oh, I don't know, 50,000,000 years of that I'd start to get a little bored. - Rick Reynolds</p>

<p>37. God should be executed for crimes against humanity. - Bryan Emmanuel Gutierrez</p>

<p>38. To say that atheism requires faith is as dim-witted as saying that disbelief in pixies or leprechauns takes faith. Even if Einstein himself told me there was an elf on my shoulder, I would still ask for proof and I wouldn't be wrong to ask. - Geoff Mather</p>

<p>39. I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it. - Mark Twain</p>

<p>40. Of all religions the Christian is without doubt the one which should inspire tolerance most, although up to now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men. - Voltaire</p>

<p>41. And if there were a God, I think it very unlikely that He would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt His existence. - Bertrand Russell</p>

<p>42. Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God? - Epicurus</p>

<p>43. I'm a polyatheist - there are many gods I don't believe in. - Dan Fouts</p>

<p>44. If it turns out that there is a God, I don't think that he's evil. But the worst that you can say about him is that basically he's an underachiever. - Woody Allen</p>

<p>45. A lie is a lie even if everyone believes it. The truth is the truth even if nobody believes it. - David Stevens</p>

<p>54. When a man is freed of religion, he has a better chance to live a normal and wholesome life. - Sigmund Freud</p>

<p>55. They felt that science would be corrosive to religious belief and they were worried about it. Damn it, I think they were right. It is corrosive to religious belief and it's a good thing. - Steven Weinberg</p>

<p>62. People will then often say, But surely it's better to remain an Agnostic just in case?' This, to me, suggests such a level of silliness and muddle that I usually edge out of the conversation rather than get sucked into it. (If it turns out that I've been wrong all along, and there is in fact a god, and if it further turned out that this kind of legalistic, cross-your-fingers-behind-your-back, Clintonian hair-splitting impressed him, then I think I would choose not to worship him anyway.) - Douglas Adams</p>

<p>72. Faith does not give you the answers, it just stops you asking the questions. - Frater Ravus</p>

<p>86. Religion is the opiate of the masses. - Karl Marx</p>

<p>88. If we expect God to subscribe to one religion at the exclusion of all the others, then we should expect damnation as a matter of chance. This should give Christians pause when expounding their religious beliefs, but it does not. - Sam Harris</p>

<p>90. Animals do not have gods, they are smarter than that. - Ronnie Snow</p>

<p>When Creationists talk about God creating every individual species as a separate act,</p>

<p>they always instance hummingbirds, or orchids, sunflowers and beautiful things.</p>

<p>But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through the eye of a boy</p>

<p>sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, [a worm] that's going to make him blind.</p>

<p>And [I ask them], 'Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God,</p>

<p>who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm</p>

<p>that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball?</p>

<p>Because that doesn't seem to me to coincide with a God who's full of mercy.[24]</p>

<p>War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere,</p>

<p>Consider the following statement from C. A. R. Hoare (case statement, quicksort fame) in</p>

<p>"Great Papers in Computer Science", 1996. He wrote a preface in 1994 to his and Wirth's paper</p>

<p>"An Axiomatic Definition of the Programming Language Pascal" to put that paper in context.</p>

<br />
<p>"One of my goals in the study of program proof techniques is to assist in the design of better programming languages, ones which make it easier to write correct programs and harder to write incorrect ones. ...</p>

<p>It is a matter of continuing regret that so few languages have ever been designed to meet that goal,</p>

<p>or even to make significant concessions towards it. For example, the programming language C was designed to</p>

<p>assist in writing a small single-user operating system (UNIX) for a real-time minicomputer (PDP 11), now thankfully</p>

<p>obsolete. For this purpose, its low level of abstraction and plethora of machine-oriented features are entirely</p>

<p>appropriate. For all other purposes, they are a nuisance. The successful propagation of the language</p>

<p>can be explained by accidental, commercial, historical, and political factors;</p>

<p>it is hardly due to any inherent quality as a tool for the reliable creation of sophisticated programs. ..."</p>

<p>-Niklaus Wirth</p>

<br />
<p>Now the thing which rather frightens me is the discovery that design is a topic that is by and large</p>

<p>not taught in our universities. Particularly not in computer science. "Programming" has become a word that you</p>

<p>look down upon. Programming? That may be done in some secondary schools, you know, but certainly not in academia,</p>

<p>at the academic level, that's below us. You go and find a professor who does programming  well, you see one before you,</p>

<p>All propaganda must be so popular and on such an intellectual level,</p>

<p>that even the most stupid of those toward whom it is directed will understand it ...</p>

<p>Through clever and constant application of propaganda, people can be made to see paradise as hell,</p>

<p>and also the other way around, to consider the most wretched sort of life as paradise.</p>

<p>Every gun that is made, every warship launched,</p>

<p>every rocket fired signifies in the final sense,</p>

<p>a theft from those who hunger and are not fed,</p>

<p>those who are cold and are not clothed.</p>

<p>This world in arms is not spending money alone.</p>

<p>It is spending the sweat of its laborers,</p>

<p>the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.</p>

<p>This is not a way of life at all in any true sense.</p>

<p>I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation,</p>

<p>I have the greatest admiration for your propaganda.</p>

<p>Propaganda in the West is carried out by experts who have had the best training in the world,</p>

<p>in the field of advertising, and have mastered the techniques with exceptional proficiency.</p>

<p>Yours are subtle and persuasive; ours are crude and obvious.</p>

<p>I think that the fundamental difference between our worlds, with respect to propaganda,</p>

<p>is quite simple. You tend to believe yours and we tend to disbelieve ours.</p>

<p>When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European,</p>

<p>or anything else, you are being violent.</p>

<p>Do you see why it is violent?</p>

<p>It is because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence.</p>

<p>So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion,</p>

<p>to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.</p>

<p>~ J. Krishnamurthi</p>

<br />
<p>If it were all so simple!</p>

<p>If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds,</p>

<p>Man is the religious animal. He is the only religious animal.</p>

<p>He is the only animal that has the True Religion, several of them.</p>

<p>He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat,</p>

<p>He has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to</p>

<p>smooth his brothers path to happiness and heaven.</p>

<br />
<p>Why of course the people don't want war.</p>

<p>Why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war</p>

<p>when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece?</p>

<p>Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England,</p>

<p>nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood.</p>

<p>But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy,</p>

<p>and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along,</p>

<p>whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship...</p>

<p>Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy.</p>

<p>All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked,</p>

<p>and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.</p>

<p>Over breakfast coffee we read of 40,000 American dead in Vietnam.</p>

<p>I dream that someday the United States will be on the side of the peasants in some civil war.</p>

<p>I dream that we will be the ones who will help the poor overthrow the rich, who will talk about</p>

<p>and that when the Red Cross or Amnesty International comes to count the bodies</p>

<p>and take the testimony of women raped, that our side won't be the heavies.</p>

<p>Throughout the world, on any given day, a man, woman or child is likely to be displaced, tortured,</p>

<p>Everyone likes to say Hitler did this and Hitler did that.</p>

<p>But the truth is Hitler did very little. He was a world class asshole, but the evil actually done,</p>

<p>from the death camps to World War Two, was all done by citizens</p>

<p>who were afraid to question if what they were told by their government was the truth or not,</p>

<p>and who because they did not want to admit to themselves that they were afraid to question the government,</p>

<p>refused to see the truth behind the Reichstag Fire,</p>

<p>refused to see the invasion by Poland was a staged fake, and followed Hitler into national disaster.</p>

<p>Stopping terrorism is simple.</p>

<p>Just quit screwing around with other people's countries and the terrorists will go home.</p>

<p>But the government of the United States wants to go on screwing around with other people's countries,</p>

<p>refuses to stop, indeed views it as Manifest Destiny for the United States Government to persist</p>

<p>in screwing around with other people's countries, and views the inconvenience,</p>

<p>increased tax burden, loss of civil liberties,</p>

<p>and even deaths among the American people as just another cost of doing business.</p>

<p>"I've begun worshiping the sun for a number of reasons. First of all, unlike some other gods I could mention,</p>

<p>I can see the sun. It's there for me every day. And the things it brings me are quite apparent all the time:</p>

<p>heat, light, food, a lovely day. There's no mystery, no one asks for money, I don't have to dress up, and there's no</p>

<p>boring pageantry. And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly</p>

<p>offered "God" are all answered at about the same 50-percent rate."</p>

<p>John Adams, on political parties:</p>

<p>"The favorites of parties, although they have always some virtues, have always many imperfections. </p>

<p>Many of the ablest tongues and pens have, in every age, been employed in the foolish, deluded, and</p>

<p>pernicious flattery of one set of partisans, and in furious, prostitute invectives against another;</p>

<p>but such kinds of oratory never had any charms for me; and if I must do one or the other, I would quarrel</p>

<p>with both parties and with every individual of each, before I would subjugate my understanding, or prostitute</p>

<p>my tongue or pen to either."</p>

<p>...when a society is in great danger, [writers are] likely to sound the alarms.</p>

<p>I have the canary-bird-in-the-coal-mine theory of the arts.</p>

<p>You know, coal miners used to take birds down into the mines with them to detect gas before men got sick.</p>

<p>The artists certainly did that in the case of Vietnam. They chirped and keeled over.</p>

<p>But it made no difference whatsoever. Nobody important cared.</p>

<p>But I continue to think that artists  all artists  should be treasured as alarm systems.</p>

<p>What work I have done I have done because it has been play.</p>

<p>If it had been work I shouldn't have done it. Who was it who said,</p>

<p>"Blessed is the man who has found his work"?</p>

<p>Whoever it was he had the right idea in his mind.</p>

<p>Mark you, he says his work--not somebody else's work.</p>

<p>The work that is really a man's own work is play and not work at all.</p>

<p>Cursed is the man who has found some other man's work and cannot lose it.</p>

<p>When we talk about the great workers of the world we really mean the great players of the world.</p>

<p>The fellows who groan and sweat under the weary load of toil that they bear never can hope to do anything great.</p>

<p>How can they when their souls are in a ferment of revolt against the employment of their hands and brains?</p>

<p>Quotes from "What I Believe", written in 1939 (EM Forster)</p>

<br />
<p>The memory of birth and the expectation of</p>

<p>death always lurk within the human being, making him separate</p>

<p>from his fellows and consequently capable of intercourse with</p>

<p>them. Naked I came into the world, naked I shall go out of it!</p>

<p>And a very good thing too, for it reminds me that I am naked</p>

<p>under my shirt, whatever its colour.</p>

<p>EM Forster</p>

<br />
<p>As soon as people have power they go crooked and sometimes dotty as well,</p>

<p>because the possession of power lifts them into a region where normal honesty never pays.</p>

<p>EM Forster</p>

<br />
<p>I believe in aristocracy, though - if that is the right word, and</p>

<p>if a democrat may use it. Not an aristocracy of power, based upon</p>

<p>rank and influence, but an aristocracy of the sensitive, the con-</p>

<p>siderate and the plucky. Its members are to be found in all</p>

<p>nations and classes, and all through the ages, and there is a secret</p>

<p>understanding between them when they meet. They represent</p>

<p>the true human tradition, the one permanent victory of our queer</p>

<p>race over cruelty and chaos. Thousands of them perish in</p>

<p>obscurity, a few are great names. They are sensitive for others</p>

<p>as well as for themselves, they are considerate without being</p>

<p>fussy, their pluck is not swankiness but the power to endure, and</p>

<p>they can take a joke.</p>

<p>EM forster</p>

<br />
<p>I realize that all society rests upon force.</p>

<p>But all the great creative actions, all the decent human relations,</p>

<p>occur during the intervals when force has not managed to come to the front.</p>

<p>These intervals are what matter.</p>

<p>I want them to be as frequent and as lengthy as possible, and I call them " civilization ".</p>

<p>EM Forster</p>

<br />
<p>The people I respect most behave as if they were immortal and as if society was eternal.</p>

<p>Both assumptions are false: both of them must be accepted as true if we are to go on eating and working</p>

<p>and loving, and are to keep open a few breathing-holes for the human spirit.</p>

<p>EM Forster</p>

<br />
<p>Some people idealize force and pull it into the foreground and worship it,</p>

<p>instead of keeping it in the background as long as possible.</p>

<p>I think they make a mistake, and I think that their opposites, the</p>

<p>mystics, err even more when they declare that force does not</p>

<p>exist.</p>

<p>I believe that it exists, and that one of our jobs is to prevent it from getting out of its box.</p>

<p>It gets out sooner or later, and then it destroys us and all the lovely things which we have made.</p>

<p>But it is not out all the time, for the fortunate reason that the strong are so stupid.</p>

<p>EM Forster</p>

<br />
<p>So two cheers for Democracy: one because it admits variety and two because it permits criticism.</p>

<p>Two cheers are quite enough: there is no occasion to give three.</p>

<p>Only Love the Beloved Republic deserves that.</p>

<p>EM Forster</p>

<br />
<p>Democracy is not a beloved Republic really, and never will be.</p>

<p>But it is less hateful than other contemporary forms of government, and to that</p>

<p>extent it deserves our support.</p>

<p>It does start from the assumption that the individual is important, and that all types are needed</p>

<p>to make a civilization.</p>

<p>It does not divide its citizens into the bossers and the bossed - as an efficiency-regime tends to do.</p>

<p>The people I admire most are those who are sensitive and want to</p>

<p>create something or discover something, and do not see life in</p>

<p>terms of power, and such people get more of a chance under a</p>

<p>democracy than elsewhere.</p>

<p>-EM Forster</p>

<p>nothing is left to chance...logic can be happily tossed out the window.</p>

<br />
<p>Galileo Galilei</p>

<p>-I do not think it is necessary to believe that the same God who has given us our senses,</p>

<br />
<p>Carl Sagan</p>

<p>-Atheism is more than just the knowledge that gods do not exist,</p>

<p>and that religion is either a mistake or a fraud.</p>

<p>Atheism is an attitude, a frame of mind that looks at the world objectively, fearlessly,</p>

<p>always trying to understand all things as a part of nature...</p>

<p>Shakti Gawain</p>

<p>-We always attract into our life whatever we think about the most,</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte</p>

<br />
<p>Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>-Shake off all the fears of servile prejudices,</p>

<p>under which weak minds are servilely crouched.</p>

<p>Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for every fact,</p>

<p>every opinion.</p>

<p>Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one,</p>

<p>he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear...</p>

<br />
<p>Albert Einstein</p>

<p>-The contemplation of this world beckoned as a liberation (...)</p>

<p>The road to this paradise was not as comfortable and alluring as the road to the religious paradise;</p>

<p>but it has shown itself reliable, and I have never regretted having chosen it</p>

<br />
<p>Justin Brown</p>

<p>-If the Bible is mistaken in telling us where we came from, how can we trust it to tell us where we're going?</p>

<br />
<p>Donald Morgan</p>

<p>-Jesus' last words on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>

<p>In a beautiful pea-green boat;</p>

<p>They took some honey, and plenty of money</p>

<p>Wrapped up in a five-pound note.</p>

<p>The Owl looked up to the moon above,</p>

<p>And sang to a small guitar:</p>

<p>"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,</p>

<p>What a beautiful Pussy you are,</p>

<p>You are,</p>

<p>You are!</p>

<p>What a beautiful Pussy you are!"</p>

<p>How charmingly sweet you sing!</p>

<p>Oh, let us be married-too long we have tarried</p>

<p>But what shall we do for a ring?"</p>

<p>They sailed away for a year and a day</p>

<p>To the land where the bong tree grows;</p>

<p>And there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood</p>

<p>With a ring at the end of his nose,</p>

<p>His nose,</p>

<p>His nose.</p>

<p>With a ring at the end of his nose</p>

<br />
<p>"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling</p>

<p>Your ring?" Said the piggy, "I will."</p>

<p>So they took it away, and were married next day</p>

<p>By the turkey who lives on the hill.</p>

<p>They dined upon mince and slices of quince,</p>

<p>Which they ate with a runcible spoon,</p>

<p>And hand in hand on the edge of the sand</p>

<p>They danced by the light of the moon,</p>

<p>The moon,</p>

<p>The moon.</p>

<p>YAGNI - Ya Ain't Gonna Need It</p>

<p>An Extreme Programming practice which states:</p>

<p>"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you</p>

<p>just foresee that you need them."</p>

<br />
<p>A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.</p>

<p>In the long run every program becomes rococo - then rubble.</p>

<p>Optimization hinders evolution.</p>

<p>Programming is an unnatural act.</p>

<p>It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.</p>

<p>Bringing computers into the home won't change either one, but may revitalize the corner saloon.</p>

<p>When we write programs that "learn", it turns out we do and they don't.</p>

<p>Documentation is like term insurance: It satisfies because almost no one who subscribes to it depends on its benefits.</p>

<p>Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be</p>

<p>discarded: that the whole point is to always see it as soap bubble?</p>

<p>One does not learn computing by using a hand calculator, but one can forget arithmetic.</p>

<p>Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them.</p>

<p>The proof of a system's value is its existence.</p>
