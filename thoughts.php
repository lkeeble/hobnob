Philosophical Thoughts
</h1>
<ul>
<li>Life is mysterious and we don't understand it at all. Nobody knows why we are here or what the meaning of life is (because there is none). We're all going to die. So don't take things too seriously.</li>
<li>All religions are made up. They help people get through life. They are also used to manipulate people and get money and free services from them.</li>
<li>Scientific formulae are typically taught as if they are perfectly obvious. In reality, they were developed painstakingly over a long period of time by people of genius. They are mathematical ways to model the physical universe but don't necessarily lead us to an understanding what is *really* happening.</li>
<li>Science doesn't provide an explanation for what life is, how the brain works and what consciousness is. Underlying all of science is quantum mechanics and nobody really understands it.</li>
<li>People who seem to have their shit together are faking it or are irrational. Nobody has the faintest idea what they are doing here and why. Considering the reality of the circumstances that we find ourselves in, being in a state of anxiety should be considered normal for an intelligent person.</li>
<li>People often wear smart clothes or talk in an overly elaborate way as a psychological trick. They are trying to convince you that they are trustworthy. See: salesmen, clergy. Beware of these people.</li>
